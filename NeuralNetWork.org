RCN integrates and builds upon various ideas from Compostional Models - ... - into a structured probabilistic graphical model such that Belief-Propagation can be used as the primary approximate inference engine.

** HTM Principles
神经生理学上的那些内容，启发了作者的基本原理？
- Common Algorithms
  + Neurons are Sparsely Activated!
- Sparse Distributed Representations(SDR)
  + Mathematical Properties
    1. Capacity of SDRs and the probability of mismatches
    2. Robustness of SDRs and the probability of error with noise
    3. Reliable classification of a list of SDR vectors
    4. Unions of SDRs
    5. Robustness of unions in the presence of noise
  + SDRs in the Brain and in HTM systems
    1. Neuron Activations are SDRs
       ......
       HTM theory says that a neuron can be in one of several states:
       - Active(Spiking)
       - Inactive (not spiking or very slowly spiking)
       - Predicted (depolarized but not spiking)
       - Active after predicted (a mini-burst followed by spiking)
    2. Neural Predictions as Unions of SDRs
    3. Synapses as a means for storing SDRs
       对Synapses的研究,似乎越來越倾向与它有记忆功能!
- Sensory Encoders
- HTM Systems are embeded within sensory-motor Systems
- HTM relies on streaming data and sequence memory
- On-Line learning
